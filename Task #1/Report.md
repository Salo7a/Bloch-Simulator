Fourier Transform
---

By applying the Discrete Fast Fourier Transform method, we obtained the Fourier Transform of an image, we then plotted its Components (Magnitude, Phase, Real Part, Imaginary Part) Separately.

---

Magnitude of an Image:

---

---

It's Phase

---

---

Non-Uniform Magnetic Field
---

We created a function that simulates the non-uniformity of a magnet, giving it the theoretical magnetic flux density in Tesla, maximum deviation due to the non-uniformity and the length of the magnet, using this data it generates a random curve we then plot this curve in our program.

---
Relaxation Process
---

Itâ€™s a process where the spins, which received a Radio Frequency pulse which caused it to change the direction of its field, to release the energy it received from the pulse while returning to its original position

---

The following image demonstrates the Rotating Frame

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
